## About

The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack started out with the idea of paying tribute
to ancient PCs and their bitmapped, pre-GUI typography (if you can call it
that). It was inspired by similar efforts that cover other vintage machines:
classic system fonts from the Amiga, C64, Apple II, Mac, ZX Spectrum, Atari
8-bit/ST etc. are all celebrated. On the other hand, the IBM PC and its clones
seem to get little love... except for that one VGA text mode font (which has
been remade numerous times, to varying degrees of success).

This collection is here to remedy that, and to bring you pixel-perfect remakes
of various type styles from text-mode era PCs - in modern, multi-platform,
Unicode-compatible TrueType form (plus straight bitmap versions).

Although the goal is to make it a complete resource, the main focus is on
hardware/firmware character sets: the kind that's located in a ROM chip on the
system board or graphics card, which is what you'd see by default when working
in text (or graphics) mode. Software-loadable fonts are also within the scope of
this collection (if associated with a particular machine or display system), so
some of these have also made it in.

## Legal Stuff

I do not claim any rights to the original raster binary data charsets, which
this work is based on. Credit for these goes to their respective designers.

The font files in this pack (TTF and FON remakes and enhancements) are my own
work, hereby licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International License.

"tl;dr" version (which is not a substitute for the license):

You may freely share and adapt / transform / enhance them for any purpose
You must give appropriate credit (with the author's name + a link to the
original material); the preferred form of attribution is my handle "VileR" and a

No warranties are given - whatever you do, I will not be held liable

Enjoy!
In addition, there are a couple of points that should be made quite clear. Out
of all the comments I've received about this collection, a small minority of
people have assumed a priori that its legal status is dubious at best, that the
original binary charsets are protected by copyrights (which are being
infringed), and/or that I act in bad faith by taking credit for my work on it.

It should be noted that I've done quite a bit of research into this issue, and
everything I've turned up supports the conclusion that there's nothing illegal
about this work. US law (which happens to have this site under its jurisdiction)
does not consider typefaces to be copyrightable material, and making derivative
versions does not infringe on anyone's intellectual property. If I was
re-distributing the original programs which render these fonts onto a computer
screen - such as firmware/driver code, or TrueType files that were the *original
distribution format* - that would've been a different story. However, all fonts
here were originally simple bitmap data; I am providing new software to
reproduce these old glyphs in different (and sometimes expanded) formats.

There's enough material online to consult on this subject if you wish (the
comp.fonts FAQ is a good starting point). It's probably safe to consider the
lack of past precedents, too. The most commonly-seen of these fonts are the ones
from IBM, which have been duplicated bit-for-bit by countless manufacturers in
their own hardware - from Hercules to nVidia - and sold with this hardware
practically everywhere on the planet. I couldn't find information about a single
lawsuit resulting from that (as opposed to, say, companies that infringed on
IBM's BIOS code). By itself, lack of precedent is not a sufficient argument, but
it does support the one already made - and precedents for NON-infringement
certainly exist (e.g. Eltra Corp. v. Ringer).

As for bad-faith arguments ("you just ripped a bunch of fonts and repackaged
them!"), rest assured that there's more to it than that. Creating this
collection has involved a lot of hard research, conversion and optimization work
to ensure that the originals are represented both faithfully and usefully,
something that is far from trivial; there are also my own additions in the
'Plus' versions and the remapped charsets. This work surely merits *some*
credit, and that is the only credit I claim.
